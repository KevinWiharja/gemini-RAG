Founded in 2015 in the heart of Jakarta, Brew Haven Coffee is a proudly local coffee shop chain dedicated to celebrating Indonesia’s rich coffee heritage. From our early beginnings as a small neighborhood café, we’ve grown into a community-centered brand that values craftsmanship, authenticity, and connection.

At Brew Haven Coffee, we focus on serving specialty coffee sourced directly from local Indonesian farmers in regions such as Gayo, Toraja, and Flores. Each bean is carefully selected and roasted to highlight its unique flavor profile, ensuring that every cup tells a story of origin, dedication, and passion. By partnering with local producers, we not only deliver exceptional quality but also support sustainable livelihoods and promote the diversity of Indonesia’s coffee culture.

Our mission is to create a warm, comfortable, and flavorful coffee experience for everyone who walks through our doors. Whether it’s your morning espresso, a quiet afternoon with friends, or a productive work session, Brew Haven Coffee is designed to be your cozy retreat from the busy city life.

Beyond coffee, we take pride in our homemade pastries—freshly baked every day—and our selection of non-coffee beverages such as matcha lattes, hot chocolate, and refreshing seasonal drinks. Each item is crafted with care to complement our coffee and cater to different tastes and moods.

More than just a café, Brew Haven Coffee is a place where people connect, unwind, and find inspiration—one cup at a time.
